# Memory-Assisted Reinforcement Learning 
Annik Carson (Last updated July 2018)

This code is used to solve reinforcement learning tasks, using a variety of modules. The file structure is as follows: 

#### Environments 
Gridworld or OpenAI gym environments which create the tasks to be solved by the RL network

#### RL Network
Standard RL architecture we develop is an actorcritic network. Can also use Q-learning, etc. 

#### Memory
Episodic caching system used to assist the RL network

#### Sensory
Networks used to create efficient representations of incoming state information. Can be used to supplement the RL network. These may be modified autoencoders, etc.

#### Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks used for running code

#### Data
Storage of data from runs for later analysis
